        We have most things we need for life and love. If you want to bless us
        with a gift, we can always use cash gifts as we move to our new place.
        That said, we know some people prefer to buy gifts off a registry. We
        created ours at Bed Bath & Beyond. Either way, we would appreciate your
        prayers and well wishes as we start this journey together!
